# NBA_Streamlit_App
INTRODUCTION:
Data was found on Kaggle. Data contains 12,306 rows and 22 columns. The Streamlit app contains information regarding average age, height, and weight over time. 
There is a pick a player/team tab which displays stats for the selected player/team. Major stat leaders are also displayed. Lastly, the colleges and countries that produce
the most NBA are listed.

Data/operation abstraction design:
The only preparation I needed to do was change centimeters to inches and kilograms to pounds

Future work:
I would like to explore relationships more (i.e. draft position and points per game average among others)
